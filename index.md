Kierkegaard was born to an affluent family in Copenhagen. His mother, Ane Sørensdatter Lund Kierkegaard, had served as a maid in the household before marrying his father, Michael Pedersen Kierkegaard. She was an unassuming figure: quiet, plain, and not formally educated, but Henriette Lund, her granddaughter, wrote that she "wielded the sceptre with joy and protected [Søren and Peter] like a hen protecting her chicks".[24] She also wielded influence on her children so that later Peter said that his brother preserved many of their mother's words in his writings.[25] His father, on the other hand, was a well-to-do wool merchant from Jutland.[25] He was a "very stern man, to all appearances dry and prosaic, but under his 'rustic cloak' demeanor he concealed an active imagination which not even his great age could blunt".[26] He was also interested in philosophy and often hosted intellectuals at his home.[27] The young Kierkegaard read the philosophy of Christian Wolff.[28] He also preferred the comedies of Ludvig Holberg,[29] the writings of Johann Georg Hamann,[30] Gotthold Ephraim Lessing,[31] Edward Young,[32] and Plato. The figure of Socrates, who Kierkegaard encountered in Plato's dialogues, would prove to be a phenomenal influence on the philosopher's later interest in irony, as well as his frequent deployment of indirect communication.
